## Let's Encrypt WP

More than just a name, Let's Encrypt WP is a battle cry to encrypt the
many WordPress websites in the world. This project is a WordPress
plugin that will provide tools for TLS certificate acquisition and
management. The first iteration of the project will include WP CLI
commands for managing certificates from [Let's Encrypt], the world's
first Certificate Authority (CA) with full support for the newly
established [Automatic Certificate Management Environment protocol
(ACME)]. Let's Encrypt also issues free certificates.
